A simple minecraft server scanner written in Python. It scans using masscan and gets more info about this server with mcstatus in the background using celery. The data is saved to mongo. You can acces the data using a discord bot written written with lightbulb. The scanner is now containerized and is easy to use. Just clone the project and start the docker compose file.
